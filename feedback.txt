Hello Denis,

Here is the review of your Django project:

- The organization and structure of your project are both strong. Your separation of Django related parts, as well as JavaScript, CSS, and SCSS files, enhances the project's comprehensibility.

- Code readability and formatting are to a high standard. It's evident that you've put in effort to make the code easy to understand.

- You've shown an adept understanding of Django and Django REST Framework features. This greatly enriches your project.

- Your database modeling is well-structured and logically executed. It shows you've understood the principles of relational database design.

- Your views and URL design are clear and easy to follow. This shows that you've prioritized the user experience in your development process.

- However, there are a couple of areas you can improve. One of them is error handling and validation. It's important to implement some form of error handling in your code. Consider using validations on your models/serializers and perhaps a try-except clause for unexpected errors.

- Another area that could use some work is the documentation. While there is some documentation, it's crucial to document all functions and classes for anyone who might need to understand or modify your code in the future.

- Finally, the integration of the backend Django REST with the rich JavaScript part, including the use of images, is nicely executed and adds value to your project.

In conclusion, your project displays a high degree of competence with Django development. Keep honing your skills and consider the feedback given. You're on the right track!

Best,
Yossi
